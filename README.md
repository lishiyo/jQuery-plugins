# TO MERGE A DETACHED HEAD COMMIT:
git checkout -b temp
git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit master origin/master temp
git diff master temp
git diff origin/master temp
// update master branch to point to temp
git checkout -B master temp
git branch -d temp

# REVERT = SAFE UNDO
git revert <commit> - doesn't change project history, undo by adding new commit

# RESET = DANGEROUS UNDO - NOT FOR PUBLIC REPOS
git reset <commit></commit> - resets staging area to most recent or specific commit, but working directory remains same
git reset --hard <commit> - resets both staging area AND working directory

# REWRITING HISTORY - NOT FOR PUBLIC REPOS
git commit --amend --no-edit // adds current staged files to last commit

REBASE - move a branch to a new base commit to maintain linear history, common for integrating upstream changes into local repo
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase master // rebase self onto tip of master
git checkout master
git merge feature-branch
// use "git rebase -i master" to clean up commits before rebasing
// use squash to squash old onto new

# SYNCING
git fetch <remote> // fetches all branches from repo as remote branches
git log --oneline origin/master
git merge origin/master

git pull --rebase <remote> // rebase to avoid merge commits

# MERGING
While you can use either fast-forward or three-way merge, many developers like to use fast-forward merges (facilitated through rebasing) for small features or bug fixes, while reserving 3-way merges for the integration of longer-running features.
- If the feature is short, rebase onto master and fast-forward merge. If your feature takes a long time to develop, use three-way.
Merge Conflicts:
- git status  // check 'both modified'
- git add -A // after done fixing conflicts
- git commit -m "merge commit"
- git branch -d feature-branch

COMMON WORKFLOW - only push to bare repos!
============
git checkout master
git fetch origin master
git rebase -i origin/master // move my branch on top of origin/master
// Squash commits, fix up commit messages etc.
git push origin master

# PULL Requests
Fork central public repo and clone onto your local 
git checkout -b some-feature
// Edit some code
git commit -am "Add first draft of some feature"
git push origin some-branch // push to your public repo
Create a pull request by going to your public repo and clicking "Pull Request"
- Mary wants to merge her feature into the main codebase, so the source branch is her feature branch, the destination repository is Johnâ€™s public repository, and the destination branch is master.
